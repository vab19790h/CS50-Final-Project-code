Hello!

My name is Vishal Barot.

My project is called CG & MI Calculator.

As the title of the website suggests, this website can help a student or anyone
to calculate Center of Gravity and Moment of Inertia.

I learned about this topic in statics and strength of materials
class.

I am currently junior standing at Univrsity of Central Oklahoma as a Mechanical
Enginneering student.

This website would take the dimentions of a certain known geometrical shape
(shown at the front page) as initial Input values and gives answers as output.
You have certain options like to change the units of the answers and limit
the digits after decimal points. A user can also save and store all their
calculations in history, considering they sign up on my website and login
before doing calculations.

I have also created 2 saperate pages which provides useful resources like videos
and websites that can help understand the concepts more clearly. A user can access
those after loginign in.

Now there are few similar websites I found online that I have used in the past
that I found when I was taking statics and strengths of materials class.

I just want to say at the end that I realy enjoyed the course you guys have put together.
The first encounter I had with cs50 was in 2018 I gave it a try and went through couple
of lectures but soon after my collage started where I took a beginning programming class
where I learned some C++ and I absolutely loved it.

This summer I could not enroll in any of the class I should be taking so I thought of
finishing up cs50 course while I could. The first lecture where we learn the scratch,
that is a game changing tool in my openion. I found it very addictive as well as the
first time I tried it back in 2018, all I end up doing is having fun with it. Thsi time
also, I spent enough time on it but I was in much more control over my time this time.

I want to specially thank David and Brian as you guys are not only great at teaching
or explaining stuff but I see how hard working and dedicated you guys are when trying
to explain things in the best way possible.

Great job by cs50 team. You all rock!
